gene_predicter.py - a program that predicts genes.

At the output it is necessary to specify the location and name of the fasta (fa) file, the output is a bed file that contains chr1 (fake chromosome), start and end coordinates and a description obtained using local BLAST.
To test the program was taken the fna sequence (gcvP.fna) of the Escherichia coli gene gcvP from NCBI.
